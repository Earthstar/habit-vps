Grassy Park adventures
Your murdercrow swoops in the air. It flies higher and higher, until it is a mere speck in the sky. Then, it swoops down and lands on your shoulder.

{{pet}} is in a garrulous mood. It picks out an annoying toy dog that is barking at a squirrel, and starts mercilessly pecking its head. When the owner comes to rescue the dog, it harasses the owner too.

Gloomy Forest

You stumble into a door standing in the middle of the woods. You try to open the door, but the doorknob won't turn. If only you had a key ...

{{pet}} draws your attention to an abandoned farmhouse. You enter, forcing the door open. Inside is some rotting furniture and scorched fireplace. {{pet}} digs around in the rafters and discovers an item.

{{pet}} has pieced together a map which shows the location of a ruined castle deep in the woods. You decide to check it out on a sunny weekend morn.

The forest undergrowth is thick and overgrown. By the time you get to the first landmark, a rock carved with a strange symbol, your clothes are torn and covered in leaves.

Next, you follow a stream downhill. The brush is thick with insects and spiders. Your murdercrow grooms some of the cobwebs out of your hair.

The stream leads to a small pond. Next to it lies the ruined masonry of the castle. In the mirrored surface of the pond, you can see a reflection of the castle in its former glory.

All is not lost though. You find a chest in the castle containing:

When wandering around the forest, you accidentally step into a circle of mushrooms. All of a sudden, the world looks ... different. The colors more vibrant, the air more clear. You can feel each fiber of your clothes and the creaking of your bones. Around you, tiny glowing sprites appear, resembling naked members of your preferred gender.

{{pet}} caws, and startles you. You fall over and crush one of the mushrooms. The effect fades, and the forest returns to its former banality.

Shafts of mellow sunshine filter through the trees as you stroll along the forest path. The peace is marred by the sound of arguing. Around the corner, you see two boys: a taller one wearing a conical hat, and a shorter one clutching a frog, both following a sprightly bluebird.

"-and that's why I think Joplin is so overrated."

"Oh hush. You've obviously never had to play an out-of-tune piano before."

"Mister Beetoven, do your think your other senses get super when you can't hear? I wonder what it's like to have super-touch. I'd rather have super-taste though. Mmm hmm."

The group does not seem to notice you as they pass by.
